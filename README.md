# Basic_Pong
 First basic game made in Unreal Engine 5 using only blueprints. Has a simple UI and with an AI enemy paddle that follows the balls incoming vector and magnitude and adjusts its veritcal position. 
 You can change the score required to win at the start UI. Also keeps tracks of some stats like games won, games lost, or games unfinished. 
 Credit goes to the youtube tutorial that I followed to make this. Was my first attempt at using blueprints and making a game with Unreal engine.
